# Procrastisaurus

*Why do it now, when you could do it later?*

## About

Procrastisaurus is a Chrome Extension where your dinosaur friend isn't really your friend, and is absolutely praying on your downfall. Productivity is the dinosaur's greatest enemy, and it'll do anything to stop you from doing your work. The longer you ignore the dinosaur, the more it'll take over your screen, through suggesting distractions and time-wasting websites, playing memes over your screens, and eventually redacting the content on your screen. 

Procrastisaurus was created for the **Most Useless Hack** category at **CTRL+HACK+DEL 2024**.
