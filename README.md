# Distractisaurus

*in case your dopamine receptors weren't already fried enough*

## About

Distractisaurus is a Chrome Extension where your dinosaur friend isn't really your friend, and is absolutely praying on your downfall. Productivity is the dinosaur's greatest enemy, and it'll do anything to stop you from doing your work. The longer you ignore the dinosaur, the more it'll take over your screen, through suggesting distractions and time-wasting websites, playing memes over your screens, and eventually redacting the content on your screen. 

Distractisaurus was created for the **Most Useless Hack** category at **CTRL+HACK+DEL 2024**.

## Steps
1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the project folder and run **npm run build**
3. Navigate to **chrome://extensions/** in your browser and load the *dist* folder
4. Enable the extension
5. Navigate to a website of your choice - if it's a productive website, wait until the dinosaur gets mad
